# Rationale

There is a [Fivetran Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/fivetran/fivetran/latest/docs) which lets a user express their Fivetran connections as code.

It would be useful if a similar provider existed for [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/), it could be implemented using the [Airbyte API](https://docs.airbyte.com/api-documentation).
